# Douglas Adams quotes

This is an example repo that I made for my talk at [All Systems Go! 2023](https://all-systems-go.io/). This is a contrived example HTTP service that returns a random Douglas Adams quote. Its design language is based on the [tailscale-dev/service-design](https://github.com/tailscale-dev/service-design) standard.

This MUST be deployed as a NixOS module. It is not intended to be used as a library or run outside of NixOS.
